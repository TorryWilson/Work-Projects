# Side project at work that helps quicken a process.
# From the 100+ vessels I monitor, we get .csv files twice a day from each one that contains temperatures, pressures, hours, etc.
# Those files (attachments) are sent from our software inside those panels to an Outlook box and then redirected to a Desktop folder on my computer.
# This desktop folder has subfolders for every vessel we monitor.
# Before this program I had to dive into every folder to make sure we were getting reports daily from the vessels.
# This program with a simple hot key function, loops through the Desktop folder and dives into each subfolder (vessel) looking for the last modified file in each subfolder.
