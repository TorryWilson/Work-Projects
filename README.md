# Work-Projects

This is a repo for side projects that I have completed / or worked on for my employer. As the only Technical Service Analyst for Louisiana CAT for the engine division, often a work day consists of creating reports, mining data, creating work orders, & etc. However, when an opportunity presents itself that I can leverage other skills I learned in my academia to help in a world of engines, I am allowed to offer solutions to better processes.
